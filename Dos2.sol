// In this example, the DoS contract has a deposit function where users can deposit
// Ether into their balance, a withdraw function where users can withdraw Ether 
// from their balance, and an attack function where an attacker can attempt to 
// send a large amount of Ether to another contract or address to consume all 
// of the available gas and cause a denial of service.

// The withdraw function has a check to ensure that the user has sufficient balance
// to withdraw the requested amount, but it does not have any limit on the number 
// of withdrawals that can be made, allowing an attacker to exhaust the contract's 
// balance by making multiple withdrawal requests.

// The attack function is designed to call another contract or address with a large
// amount of Ether, potentially causing it to run out of gas and preventing other
// transactions from being processed on the network. This can lead to a denial of 
// service attack on the affected contract or address.
